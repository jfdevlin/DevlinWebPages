                               The Point Velocity Probe (PVP) research began with prototypes designed by Devlin, and constructed by undergraduates
                               at the University of Waterloo (Steve DiBiasi, Nora Donald).  This led to more detailed testing by Labaky <i>et al.</i> (2007),
                               who demonstrated the technology in the laboratory and with numerical models.  Field comparisons of the PVP against other
                               velocity estimation methods were reported by Labaky <i>et al.</i> (2009).
                               <br><br>
                               The first application of PVPs was for investigating the effects of biostimulation on flow in a gasoline plume (Schillig
                               <i>et al.</i> 2011).  For this project, PVPs were stacked in multilevel arrays to provide a detailed picture of groundwater
                               velocity on a transect across the ambiant flow direction (Devlin <i>et al.</i>, 2009, see image at right).
                               This work also linked bioactivity to
                               measureable ground penetrating radar response, raising the possibility that radar could be used to infer zones of altered
                               flow in <i>in situ</i> treatment zones (Schillig <i>et al.</i>, 2010).  Subsequently, PVPs were used to map the velocity
                               field around a recirculating well in an effort to define the flow experimentally and explain tracer behavior
                               (Devlin <i>et al.</i>, 2012).
                               <br><br>
                               Ongoing work is underway to simplify the assembly of PVPs using a a 3D model of the device and a prototype printer.
                               PVPs are also being used to localize the onset of microbial growth in an heterogeneous aquifer by examining local flow
                               changes in a denitrification treatment zone that differ from background changes.  Further plans are underway to use
                               PVPs to document flow in stream banks in the USA and the South Pacific, and in regional flow studies of flow through thin,
                               continuous beds in western Canada.

                              The Point Velocity Probe (PVP) was completely rethought to develop a version of the probe suitable for
                              deployment in wells or open boreholes in fractured media.  The new device is called the "In-Well Point
                              Velocity Probe" or IWPVP.  The probe has been extensively tested in laboratory tanks at KU and in
                              the research labs at a TOTAL facility in Pau, France.  Groundwater velocities determined in
                              porous media well deployments at the C.F.B. Borden field site, and at a facility in France showed
                              good agreement with velocities measured using the PVP.  Flux distributions in fractured rock wells
                              at the Edwards Airforce Base compared well with those determined by redox distributions and
                              passive flux meter profiles.

                              The Point Velocity Probe (PVP) was modified to operate inside a cylindrical
                              cartridge that was installed in an HRX Treatment Well.  The HRX Well is
                              installed in an aquifer horizontally in the direction of groundwwater flow.
                              In passive operation the HRX Well is packed with highly permeable reactive media
                              so that groundwater captured by the well is treated as it passes from the up-gradient
                              end to the down-gradient end.  This system is intended for use in low permeability
                              aquifers, such as those comprising a notable silt fraction, so that the hydraulic
                              conductivity contrast between the aquifer and the packed well is large, and the
                              capture zone of the well is maximized.  The PVP permitted near real-time assessments
                              of flow through the HRX Well for verification that it was capturing the groundwater
                              at the anticipated rates.  The work was conducted at the Vandenberg Air Force Base
                              in California, and both the PVP and HRX Well performed as designed.

                              In an effort to expand the toolbox for quantifying water flow rates between groundwater and surface water,
                              the point velocity probe concept (see "Direct Measurement of Groundwater Velocity", below) was adpated to
                              measuring vertical flow rates at the streambed-streamwater interface.  The novel probe was tested in the
                              laboratory using a modified NeST aquifer simulator (Bowen <i> et al.</i>, 2012) to simulate a streambed.
                              It was then field tested at the Grindsted stream in Jutland, Denmark, where the flow rates were used to
                              estimate contaminant mass discharges into the stream. The device was found to provide fast and accurate water
                              velocity measurements in the sandy streambed of the study site.  The probe was later applied to the measurement
                              of infiltration rates in the passive treatment pond at Commerce, Oklahoma, operated by the University of
                              Oklahoma.

                              The work began with investigations into the effects of sorption, competition, aging and and assessment of
                              the role of Fe<sup>2+</sup> on the reduction of organic compounds by granular iron (Devlin <i>et al.</i>, 1998).
                              An evaluation of Fe<sup>0</sup> as an electron donor for denitrification followed (Devlin <i>et al.</i>, 2000).
                              To preserve the iron surface from abrasion during batch tests, the GEM reactor was developed, in which the iron
                              is held stationary by a magnet while the solution is stirred (Devlin and Allin, 2005).  This apparatus was
                              used to show that common anions in groundwater, at concentrations within the typical range, exert a notable effect
                              on iron reactivity (Devlin and Allin, 2005).  Carbonate was paradoxically reported to be a reactivity enhancer
                              and a reactivity depressant in various studies by others.  The GEM reactor was used to show that the complex behavior was
                              due in part to shifting stabilities of iron oxides and carbonates, depending on the carbonate solution concentration
                              (Bi <i>et al.</i>, 2009).  The limitations of mass transport on contaminant reduction rates was investigated
                              in sand-granular iron mixtures.  It was found in experiments with both chlorinated solvents, and the much
                              faster reacting nitroaromatics, that more than 25% by weight sand caused notable declines in contaminant transformation
                              rates (Bi <i>et al.</i>, 2009). Visualization tests indicated that the most reactive medium (highest rates per unit
                              mass of iron) are associated with about 15% sand, 85% iron mixtures by weight because the sand particles
                              promote better solution-iron surface contact by separating the grains from each other (Firdous and Devlin, in prep).<br><br>

                              The preceding work was based primarily on a simple conceptual model of reactions on the iron surface, i.e., that the
                              surface can be treated as an homogeneous one with sorption occurring only to reactive sites.  The development of
                              a Kinetic Iron Model (KIM) provided a means of divorcing the contributions of sorption from those of reaction
                              in contaminant disappearance rates (Devlin, 2009).  The KIM permitted quantification of the isotherm parameters
                              describing sorption to reactive sites as distinct from non-reacting sites, which could be evaluated from retarded
                              transport (Bi <i>et al.</i>, 2010).

                              As iron ages, the rate of the reactions with organics seems to shift its dependency from a relatively small number of
                              sites with fast electron transfer to  a larger number of sites with slower electron transfer.  This is indicated by
                              declines in rate constants and increases in sorption capacities, as determined by the kinetic testing with the KIM (Bei, 2011).
                              The importance of sorption raises the possibility that carbon on the iron surface is active in determining the surface
                              reactivity.  Raman analysis of aging iron grains confirms the changing character of carbon, and XRD suggests increasing
                              carbon presence on the surface with increasing age, lending additional credence to the hypothesis that carbon is important
                              (Firdous, 2013).

                               Nitrate is the most common groundwater contaminant in the world.  It is introduced to groundwater mainly through
                               agricultural activity, and is widespread as a result.  Removal of nitrate from groundwater is difficult to do at a
                               reasonable cost.  Removal <i>in situ</i> is a promising alternative.  This research began with an assessment of
                               stimulating <i>in situ</i> denitrification in an aquifer near the town of Baden, Ontario.  A carbon source in the
                               form of acetate was shown to be a highly effective electron donor for denitrification throughout the aquifer (Devlin
                               <i>et al.</i>, 2000).  A pilot test ensued in which acetate was injected across the ambient flow direction in
                               weekly pulses that were allowed mix by dispersion as the acetate was transported toward a pumping municipal well.
                               A detailed assessment of the heterogeneity of the site was made prior to a pilot scale remediation test (Gierczak
                               <i>et al.</i>, 2006).  The system achieved complete nitrate removal within the test zone, with no noticeable
                               iron or sulfate reduction, and no nitrite production (Gierczak <i>et al.</i>, 2007).
                               <br><br>
                               The success of the Baden experiments led to the work continuing at the municipal wells located outside Woodstock,
                               Ontario, in collaboration with Dr. David Rudolph at the University of Waterloo and Oxford County, Ontario.
                               The heterogeneity at the Woodstock site was found to be more pronounced than what had been observed at
                               Baden, based on PVP velocity measurements and a natural gradient tracer test (Critchley <i>et al.</i>, 2014).
                               Groundwater velocities at the site were observed to be as high as 30 m/day.  Nonetheless, laboratory testing of
                               core material has shown that denitrifying bacteria are present throughout the aquifer.  A pilot scale
                               cross-injection test, similar to the Baden experiment, indicated acetate could stimulate denitrification at the
                               site, but additional work is needed to optimize the process in the highest velocity layers.

                             in November, 2022, in a related poster, described the characterization of flow
                             beneath a northern Minnesota lake three-quarters filled with
                             an organic rich muck.  It was found that flow was diverted around the perimeter of
                             the lake, mainly in a thin zone near the interface between the aquifer and the muck layer.
                             Groundwater in this zone was apparently moving at velocities 50 times faster -or more -
                             than in the surrounding aquifer.

                               <P><b>Best Student Paper at AGU.</b>  With the rise of permeable reactive
                               barriers for groundwater remediation, questions need to be asked concerning how long they
                               last and what controls their performance.  It is frequently noted that rates of pollutant
                               transformation in laboratory tests do not match rates observed in the field.  In this work
                               it is hypothesized that residence time in the reactive zone of an aquifer undergoing bioremediation
                               is affected by the microbial activity there.  Peter Schillig performed his Masters research on this
                               topic for which he was awarded best student paper at the AGU Joint Assembly, Acapulco, Mexico, in May, 2007.
                               Peter was also awarded the prestigious Self Fellowship to continue his research at the doctoral
                               level at KU. In 2009 he was awarded a GSA grant to conduct laboratory column tests aimed at linking
                               aquifer texture to microbial hot spots.  At right Peter poses beside the grill of a Dept. SUV containing feathers from a turkey

                              with granular iron depends on both the quantity
                              sorbed and the surface reaction rate.  Similar rates might be observed for the two
                              distinct cases in which either sorption is large but surface reactions are low, or
                              sorption is low but surface reaction rates are high. Unfortunately, uniquely calculating
                              the sorption and reaction parameters necessary to model such scenarios is difficult for
                              reacting species.  The literature reports only one extraction based method to accomplish this

                              Over the past few years, field trials were carried out to test the viability of
                              sequencing <i>in situ</i> technologies for groundwater remediation.
                              The first such test was conducted at the Alameda Naval Air Station (pictured
                              at right), where granular iron and a biosparge unit were coupled to remove a mixture
                              of chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons from the groundwater
                              The test facility performed very well, removing over 99% of the cis-dichloroethene
                              that was initially present in the water (> 200 mg/L in some locations) and all
                              detectable hydrocarbons (max. BTEX = 10 mg/L).
                              This work was published in 2000 in the Journal of Contaminant Hydrology with
                              Morkin, Barker and Butler.  See <a href="Publications.html">Publications</a> for the

                              <P>Sequenced <i>in situ</i> treatment was also tested in a controlled field experiment
                              at the CFB Borden site.
                              In that test, two biodegradation systems were constructed in series to treat a plume 
                              containing carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, tetrachloroethene and toluene.
                              The first treatment was anaerobic biodegradation stimulated by benzoate and nutrient
                              additions made from a nutrient injection wall (NIW).
                              The second treatment was aerobic biodegradation from a residual oxygen barrier (ROB).
                              The two treatment units were constructed in a 24 m long sheet pile alleyway.
                              Pictured at right is the enclosure built to protect the experiment.
                              Removal rates exceeding 99% were experienced for all primary compounds except toluene.
                              Also, low but detectable amounts of cis-dichloroethene were close to breakthrough a the
                              end of the experiment.
                              Both these problems could be alleviated with diminished benzoate additions at the NIW,
                              thus reducing oxygen demand at the ROB.  This work was coauthored with Katic and Barker, 
                              and was published in the Journal of
                              Contaminant Hydrology in 2004.</P>
