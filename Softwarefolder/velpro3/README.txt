VelProbePE_3
- extensive additions of user friendly forms including central control panel
- optional signal inversion to handle saline tracers and DI water
- breakthrough curves now have table of calculated breakthrough with formulas that can be manually manipulated to aid optimization
- formulas now present in PVP calculations on "Results" sheets to aid troubleshooting
- reset button added to control panel so baseline manipulations can be easily removed and the curves reanalyzed from scratch
- overview sheet now created with graphical representations of all half bridge data for comparision and distinction of noise from peaks
- button added to "datalogger file" tab to reinitiate analysis; but to create "Overview" sheet also present there
- button added to permit 16 HB channel files to be trimmed to the desired number of HBs
- option added to enter default transport parameters and distances to detectors when breakthrough curve analysis begins
- dialog boxes reduced in size and moved to upper left of screen to improve visibility of spreadsheets
- updating of transport input parameters (userform4) occurs from dashboard launch of userform4 and from baseline userform
